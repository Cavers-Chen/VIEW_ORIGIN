Hey! This is my CG project and I want to make a tiny engine, which contains abilities to render a scene and simulate some specific physical movements.

I'll update my code periodically and make some manuals on my GitHub project website.

Wish you have fun!

This project tries not to include the third part lib, but Eigen is an efficient lib, which could save our time to template the Matrix lib. You can easily configure this lib by searching the tutorial on the internet.
